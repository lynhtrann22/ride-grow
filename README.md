## I. Context & Innovative Problem
The educational climate in Cambodia is largely inhibited by the high rates of grade repetition, school dropout, and low student achievement with particular issues of student demotivation and lack of accessible transportation to school. It becomes a major concern since truants are more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol and become delinquent.

## II. Proposal Solution
To address attendance issues by looking at motivation and transportation as two major factors contributing to absenteeism in Cambodia, our team proposed Ride & Grow–a school bike leasing service. 

### HOW IT WORKS
1. **Bicycles**: Bicycles are sourced from ‘Bicycle graveyards’ in China and then recovered, and transported to Cambodia to be distributed to rural school students.

2. **A deferred payment program**: Ride & Grow will be funded by the schools directly, however, payments will only have to be made once attendance has actually increased. 

3. **Free breakfast & Agricultural program**: To incentivise students to come to school using Ride & Grow bike system and remain within the school system, a free breakfast plan is implemented, the resources for which are supplemented through implementations of an agricultural program where students can engage in sustainable farming to ‘grow their own breakfasts’.
